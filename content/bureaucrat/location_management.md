## Location management

Locations are managed under the Locations > Manage locations menu.

For every location, a name must be provided, while Description, map and DECT information is optional. You can also assign angels by type to locations on scheduled import.

### Locations and shifts

Every shift has a room assigned, this is done in the shift creation dialogue.
