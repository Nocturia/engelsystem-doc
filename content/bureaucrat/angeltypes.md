## Angeltypes

Angeltypes categorize the requirements needed to fulfill that specific work, meaning you only have to specify the amount of this or that angeltype per shift.

### creating a new angeltype

- name: the name to display
- requires introduction: has to be verified by a supporter or higher to be able to sign up for shifts
- shift self signup: indicates whether the angel can sign up for shifts or whether supporters or higher have to assign shifts for that angeltype (true means "angel can sign up for shifts")
- requires driver license: if enabled, the tool will check the required driver license against the users driver licenses (check!)
- requires health instruction: indicates whether it is needed or not (mostly for departments that deal with food or similar)
- show on dashboard: whether the angels will show on the dashboard (public!)
- hide at registration: indicates whether the angeltype is available for newly registered users in the registration process. This does not affect the visibility on the angeltypes-page!
- Hide on shift view: indicates whether the filter option on the shifts tab is available for everyone or just members of the angeltype and admins.
- description: markdowned description displayed on the teams-/job description
- contact information: displayed on the teams-/job description as well
